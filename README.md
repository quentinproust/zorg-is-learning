# zorg-is-learning

Small project for "the child at home" renamed here Zorg, 
who wanted more exercises she liked but teacher moved on another matter.

The exercice is simple :

- you have lists of numbers
- you need to tell previous number
- you need to tell next number
- you need to write the number in letters
- you need to decompose the number, for exemple 54 is 50 + 4

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally

```
